Hi, I'm Sydney Franks 👋

I'm a Software Engineering student at Arizona State University, pursuing my undergraduate degree online while working nights as a bartender. Outside of my coursework, I'm teaching myself Python and AI engineering because I'm passionate about staying ahead of the curve in emerging technologies.

I've always had an entrepreneurial spirit. I've built multiple businesses and scaled one to $100k in revenue within a year. Now I'm shifting that same drive and business-building mindset into software development. I see each app as a mini business: something that solves real problems, creates value, and has the potential to scale. I'm particularly interested in building apps and software that make a tangible impact on people's lives.

On the side, I work on cozy game projects. My goal is to combine my technical skills with creative storytelling and design. I'm determined to make the full transition from bartending to a career in tech, and I'm documenting the entire journey on TikTok. From late-night coding sessions to project demos, business lessons, and failures along the way. This portfolio is where I showcase the projects I'm building.

PSEUDO++ is a project management app for new developers

Description:
A project planning and organization tool designed to help developers build apps from scratch with clarity and structure. PSEUDO++ lets you plan features, write pseudocode, create flowcharts, design methods and classes, and track progress through a visual dashboard. Each feature can be broken down into pseudocode, functions, and implementation steps, making the transition from idea to code seamless. Perfect for students, learners, and anyone who needs help staying organized while building software.
Technologies: Python, React
Status: In Development
Link: [Coming soon]

10,000-Hour Study Tracker

Description:
A minimalist time-tracking application inspired by the 10,000-hour mastery concept. This tool focuses on one core function: tracking minutes spent practicing or studying a skill over time. Users log sessions, see cumulative progress, and build awareness around consistency rather than short-term productivity.

This project highlights my ability to intentionally scope software, focus on a single core metric, and implement clean, reliable logic without unnecessary complexity. By narrowing the feature set to time accumulation and progress tracking, I emphasized clarity, accuracy, and maintainable code. The tracker demonstrates disciplined problem definition, data handling, and incremental development, reinforcing a strong foundation in building software that does exactly what it claims to do.

Technologies: Java
Status: Basic Backend Complete | UI in progress
